This project will aim to review and analyze Masataka Yoshida's first 27 games with the Boston Red Sox. Yoshida notably went on a 14 game hit streak after a slow start to his debut season. I will look to understand pitch data, varying approaches, swing data, etc., to undersatnd what Yoshida may have changed after 12 games to turn his season around.
